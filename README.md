## About the project

This course builds on prior experience with Dynamic Web Fundamentals and programming. Students will focus on user experience, accessibility, compliance, performance optimization, and basic API usage. 

## Versions

For each workflow, a new version will be implemented.
The pattern for this repository will follow:

    - First digit: week
    - Second digit: 1 for README, 2 for release, 3 for fix
    - Third digit: number of commits

## Naming Conventions

[This content] will be expected to follow these naming conventions throughout the course.

- Use all lowercase syntax, e.g., products.html

    > Platforms and systems handle case sensitivity differently. Case sensitivity is an important concept to understand when managing files and folders.

- Do NOT use spaces in names. Use dashes instead, e.g., design-document.html

    > Spaces are interpreted poorly by user agents. Do not use them. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) ignores spaces, except in file names. In file names, it replaces a space with a symbol—"%20." This makes URLs look confusing and can also lend itself to confusion in the minds of site visitors. So avoid using spaces. Instead, if you have to create a visual space, use hyphens/dashes.

- Do NOT use special characters, e.g., <,>, \, /, #, ?, !

    > Special characters often mean specific things to computers, so just avoid using them completely in the naming of files and folders.

- Use as short and as meaningful (semantic) names as possible, e.g., winter-scene-sm.png vs. image13-v123523brokenbranchlifeimagery w200x200.png

    > Short, meaningful names save you, other developers, and site visitors from having to remember long, complicated names for files and folders. When meaningful, they also help predict the purpose or nature of the file or folder contents when working with those files or folders.

- In this class, the standard folder names for the sites/sub-folders are:
    - styles – Folders with this name contain the CSS files.
    - images – Folders with this name contain the images.
    - scripts – Folders with this name contain the JavaScript files.
